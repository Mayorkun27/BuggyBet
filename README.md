# Journey
First and foremost, I'd like to say: This is not just a project but a brainchild.

The visions of tens of Developers put together to achieve a common goal, a brainchild which we are presenting to the world as "BuggyBet".

What actually started as a joke inside of a public transit, as a laughter medium while strolling home after a tiresome day as a developer is gradually becoming reality and soon enough (even sooner than you or we ourselves can imagine),The "Brain-Joke-Child" will cease to be a fantasy and be given birth to as reality...One even bigger than our very own lone existence.

This brain child has not only brought us all together but also strengthened our severed ties, renewed our faint connection, revived our drying fountain of brotherhood and thickened our family bloodline.

# Accolades
A very big THANK YOU to the man who made it all possible, the man who has raised leaders and begat nations yet as meek as a lamb @Dave-pea, We all say Thank you for the constant mentoring, pushing, jokes and all you do really....Words ain't enough to tell of all the great and wonderful things you've done...Realest OG I've ever met.

Also another Thank you to the founder of the community @Olatunji-Ibrahim, if you had never came up with the idea of bringing the community to life, Heaven knows where we all will be today...Your brain child is what we exist on today and that is why we are also pushing our own brain child today (Giving back to the community).

Another one to the Sunmence table, to all our senior developers who have in one way or other (consciously or unconsciously) shaped our lives even in ways they could not imagine and to the community at large, We could not have accomplished this lot without each and every single one of y'all, It is a great priviledge to be part of this wonderful community really.

All progress made so far is as a result of the immense cooperation, insight, effort, brainwork and teamwork.

Special Thanks to @seniorcub, @Tajudeen, @Timmy-jay and myself (@Mayorkun27) for all their time, efforts and optimism.
